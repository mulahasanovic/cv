## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of this project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Entry.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LinkWithArrow.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Footer.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ PersonalDetails.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Section.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Skill.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ education/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 01_school.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ experiences/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 01_template_job_1.md
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 02_template_job_2.md
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 03_template_job_3.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ global.css
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name. In our case for the resume template, we are skipping over that feature but we make use of `education` and `experiences` folders to dynamically fill out their respective sections with `await Astro.glob<EntryProps>("../experiences/*.md");` command.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory. This is where you can put your profile picture, or you can put it in `images` and replace `images/person_placeholder.svg`.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
