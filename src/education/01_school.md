Entries for education work the same way as experiences. You can customize these sections how you like, change titles, remove them, or create new folders and sections that use them by editing **index.astro**, etc.

If you are not sure about a section, and you don't want to delete it, comment it out or you can hide it by setting **visible** attribute to **false**.
