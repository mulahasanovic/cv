_Achievements_

The initial systems and modular design enabled us to add new tools easily, which allowed us to
respond quickly to clients' feedback, iterate on tools design and improve the app consistently
without any operation interruptions or large code refactors.

The custom design and the constraints of not using any frameworks and plugins (except
jQuery and later a plugin for a nicer scrollbar) led me to create several internal systems that fit
the app's needs without any extra overhead.
I'm proudest of the system we have in place for creating and drawing out graphs on
canvases with user interaction and read-out of changes with smooth 60fps animations.
