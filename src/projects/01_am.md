#### Sportsbook Risk Management

- Implementation of the new version of the Asianmonitor app - modular and easily extensible single-page app with PHP and JS (w/ jQuery).
- Introduction of Babel and Sass for an improved workflow.
- Improved the UX and provided constant feedback to the team and the designer.
- Development of the new Asianmonitor homepage, help docs, and demo page.
- Creation of the admin dashboard with real-time app control, news, and notifications.
- The continued support and development of the Asianmonitor app (slack integration, theme, localization, additional tools and modules, optimizations of the existing code and security improvements).
- Responding to the client's feedback and support.

_Achievements_

The initial systems and modular design enabled us to add new tools easily, which allowed us to respond quickly to clients' feedback, iterate on tools design and improve the app consistently without any operation interruptions or large code refactors.

The custom design and the constraints of not using any frameworks and plugins (except jQuery) led me to create several internal systems that fit the app's needs without extra overhead.
I'm proudest of the system we have in place for creating and drawing out graphs on canvases with user interaction and read-out of changes with smooth 60fps animations.
