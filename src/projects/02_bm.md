_Achievements_

Navigating the quirks and inconsistencies between devices and browsers in mobile space
was challenging, especially with the amount of data Betmonitor had to show neatly on
screen at any given time, but we were happy with the result.

The designer's inspiration for Betmonitor Pro was the Apple AirPods Pro page which had
animations based on the page scroll positions. I've built a animation/transition system that
was easily editable in HTML with a few predefined data tags and properties (classes,
opacity, transforms, colours, or any CSS value), which enabled us to quickly design, iterate
and build animation sequences for each section of the page separately.
