You can use limited markdown. I've added basic styles to **ul**, **ol**, **em** and **strong**. You can remove **tailwind preflight** and tinker with the css to enable full markdown styling.

Anyway, some of these words _are emphasized_.
Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.

Lists work as expected:

- Candy.
- Gum.
- Rubber Duck.

Ordered (numbered) lists use regular numbers, followed by periods, as list markers:

1.  Red
2.  Green
3.  Blue
