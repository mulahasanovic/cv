Dental Management System

- The project pivoted from a broad ERP to a more focused and efficient solution, refining its functionalities. This shift, driven by feedback and resource considerations, aims to better align with current needs.
- I was involved with research, design, planning, and development.
- The most notable feature I've worked on is the Odontogram, with dynamic selection, standardised data parsing, and visualisation.

Tech: React, Mantine, Axios, Go, Java, Springboot
